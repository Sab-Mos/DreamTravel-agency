          It's also about the vibrant energy that surrounds the district, day
          and night. Whether you're walking down the bustling streets of Times
          Square or grabbing a pre-show dinner at one of the area's many
          excellent restaurants, you'll feel the pulse of the city as you soak
          in the sights and sounds of Broadway. It's a place that's constantly
